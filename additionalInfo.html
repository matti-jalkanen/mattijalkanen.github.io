            <br>I have served in the Finnish Defence Forces for 12 months. I was stationed in the armoured brigade of
            Parolannummi. I applied, and was accepted to enter the special forces training required to operate a Main
            Battle Tank. I am a certified gunner and loader of the Main Battle Tank Leopard 2 A 4. This position
            demanded supremely high people skills and the skill to work with other members of my team even in
            extreme and difficult conditions under extreme pressure.
            <br><br>During my service I was promoted to the rank of Private First Class.
